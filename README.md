# threeohseven

A group project.

The goal of this project was to recreate a service like Linktree where users can create their own pages that contain links. Users can create an account and sign in, edit their own page, and view the pages of other users. Each page is comprised of links and categories that can be updated.

Currently we have a feature-complete backend, but it does not work well with the front end because of cross-orgin cookies issues that we did not have time to debug. Our front end includes a landing page, an about page, a login page, a sign up page, and the ability to view user's pages. The edit page does not currently update the user's page due to CORS issues.

We used ESLint and Prettier for linting this project.

threeohseven was created with **Turborepo**. Turborepo manages packages, dependencies, and pipelines automatically.

The `app` package is a **React** app built with **Vite**

The `server` package is an **Express** app.

Typescript is supported throughout the project!

For the backend server, a `.env` file is required to be in the `packages/sever` directory.
